##  tl;dr

My journey and some insights regarding organisation, systems, second brains, digital zettelkasten.
1. Why?
2. What?
3. Who?
4. How?
5. Where to?


### 1. Why?
More than five years ago I started by collecting and sorting:
- What I spent my time/ energy on
- What I cared about and/or wanted to improve
- Digital stuff (books, links, articles etc.) I had accumulated 

To give some idea of what that looked like:

I also created a framework, tech-stack and grand scheme for being able to plan and accurately time-track everything I spent time on (cue mild shivering and visions of [_the quantified self_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_self)) — but that's for another entry.


### 2. What?

What I got to was a sort of high level taxonomy (venn diagram) that covered everything via the categories of Living, Earning and Growing (LEG) and their intersections which broke down into 10 'goals' and then 50 areas. (This evolved quite a bit - another, other entry). This felt like progress since I could initially sort everything, cascade down the taxonomy to the right area and moving forward knew where to save things. (Note - I still had/have a 'misc.' category (cool_interesting_useful) which kind of feels like a cheat but seems to have-to exist to demonstrate [the set of all things not in a set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox)). 

It looked like this:

However - it lacked the ability to see in detail the connections between items and perhaps to generate new and interesting ideas or comparisons.

### 3. Who?
Enter stage links (left in german ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ) Niklas Luhmann - German sociologist, philosopher of social science, prominent thinker in systems theory and all round prolific writer. Over 30+ years he published 70 books and almost 400 articles - there are also over 150 unfinished manuscripts left in his estate — at least one of them is a text of 1000 pages. He was famous for his extensive use of the "slip box" or _[Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten "Zettelkasten")_ note-taking method. He built up a zettelkasten (it can be seen digitised and translated via Google [here](https://www-heise-de.translate.goog/news/Missing-Link-Luhmanns-Denkmaschine-endlich-im-Netz-4364512.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US&_x_tr_pto=wapp&hg=1&hgi=2&hgf=false)) of some 90,000 index cards for his research, and credited it with making his extraordinarily prolific writing possible. The chief hack was a numbering system and fixed addresses but zettelkasten is really the act of breaking your sources into concepts written in your own words and then linking those concepts into existing notes in a way that builds meaningful relationships between the ideas. This way, you should come to understand the concepts you’re learning and thinking about more deeply as well as building a persistent representation of that understanding.

This is obviously super useful for future writing and reading, or can just act as a set of notes which help thinking things through as you add more depth and context. This is why people sometimes call a zettelkasten an external brain.

Speaking of which, Vannevar Bush - visionary American engineer, inventor, science administrator, and policymaker known for pioneering early computing, leading wartime research, shaping postwar science policy and conceptualizing the memex - a hypothetical device described in “[As We May Think](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/?single_page=true "As We May Think")”. Envisioned as an analog computer to supplement human memory, the memex (a combination of “memory” and “index”) would store and automatically cross-reference all of the user’s books, records and other information. This cross-referencing, which Bush called associative indexing, would enable users to quickly and flexibly search huge amounts of information and more efficiently gain insights from it. The concept of the memex influenced the development of early [hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext "Hypertext") systems, eventually leading to the creation of the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web "World Wide Web"), and [personal knowledge base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_base "Personal knowledge base") software.

 

### 4. How?

There's already masses of material on the internet not to mention hours of productivity/life-hack/self-improvement porn on Youtube discussing 'second-brains', note-taking, zettelkasten and lots of different personal knowledge software. For just sorting my digital material I used a file/folder structure based on the above and for notes I ended up with Obsidian (Not open source but free for personal use - I paid a one off Catalyst license (Insider) to support development) with an identical  structure. Into those I sorted the previously mentioned files, images, links, notes, books etc. Before I started improving/evolving it this year, the notes in Obsidian looked like this:
