Introduce myself beyond LinkedIn  
Sharing  
Documenting  
Writing  
Learning  
Find potential collaborators  

### Re-cap

I have had a couple of blogs (now archived) where I shared various thoughts and things of interest. I learned a lot (as possibly did my literally dozens of visitors...)

Such as:

- It's easy find things interesting and valuable but much harder to say something interesting and valuable
- If you're not a genius then having to make words up for things probably isn't a good sign ಠಿ_ಠ
- etc

So that's what this asldkgjalsk

## Introducing myself beyond LinkedIn

I think of LinkedIn as architectural in the sense that it's 900 Million Storefronts with a finite number of facade patterns. Nothing wrong in that - it's everyone is there - competing for attention from bots and browsers. The marketplace of ideals.
