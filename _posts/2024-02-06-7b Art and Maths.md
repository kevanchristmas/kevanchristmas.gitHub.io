##  tl;dr

- Visualising Maths helps us learn. Using maths for visualisations can create new aesthetic expression.
- Advances in Data Science open even more opportunities
- It's interesting and fun to play with.

**_Intro and Warning_:**

A very much unfinished series of thoughts that pulls together three (or possibly four) of my [Self-Authoring](https://www.selfauthoring.com/) goals which will have to be another piece. In pursuit of these I have been semi-studying further Maths, Data Science and AI plus [urban sketching](https://www.urbansketch.co.uk/) (all of which will have to be also be covered elsewhere - a hernialog rather than a backlog?)

The first two are pretty orthogonal and the third is really about mental health. This aspect reminded me of one of the things I did whilst stranded in the first year of Covid - reconnecting with an old friend and picking interesting things to introduce each other to in weekly calls. He's a teacher with a Masters in Art Education and during one of our sessions I chose a [sculpture](https://www.londontsai.com/sculpture/view/582081/1/732065) by London Tsai who does a lot of physics and maths inspired work (think differential geometry, torus, hopf vibration etc.) and a collection of music/visuals called the [physics of beauty](https://physicsofbeauty.art/) by Clemens Wenger.

My interest was (and remains) in the general concept of beauty (_certainly_ too big for an entry on here any time soon, but who knows...) and having begun with patterns in Nature, particularly inspired by the work of [Philip Ball](https://philipball.co.uk/natures-patterns-a-tapestry-in-three-parts/), I was already out of my depth beyond the Fibonacci series and Golden Ratio. I was however, ready for the idea that 
'art' (don't start on that..) could be created by an autonomous system - even if the system represents the idea of the creator. Whether they are beautiful is for another discussion.

## Artistic Algorithms: Bridging Data Science, Mathematics, and Art

Visualiation is a very powerful tool in learning mathematics as it helps transform abstract ideas into more tangible, visual forms. Diagrams aside, using graphs to illustrate functions helps to show how changes in variables affect the overall equation. Similarly, geometric visualisation can aid in understanding properties and theorems in a more intuitive way.

Mathematics has always influenced art, providing a framework through which artists explore symmetry, structure, and pattern.

It wasn't just using maths to guide, representing the maths or even the results of playing with the maths - the data itself can be transformed with models and data analytics to transform abstract numbers into informative and often interactive art pieces, where the collaboration among artists, mathematicians, and data scientists results in works that are both visually captivating and intellectually engaging.

In some cases, in our the digital age, where data flows ubiquitously, the intersection of data science, mathematics, and art presents a unique narrative shape for our interpretation and interaction with the world, in others, it just creates things that I like looking at.

### Some examples

Reuben Margolin - a renowned kinetic sculptor, combines the precision of mathematics with the fluidity of art in his mesmerizing wave sculptures. Inspired by natural phenomena, he uses complex calculations to mimic the motion of waves and other forms of natural energy. Margolin’s work exemplifies the seamless integration of physical dynamics and aesthetic beauty, driven by a mathematical understanding of nature - [portfolio](http://www.reubenmargolin.com/).

Refik Anadol, another pioneer uses data and machine learning to create art installations that interpret vast datasets. A piece like "Machine Hallucinations" involves AI sifting through millions of images to produce stunning visualizations that explore the architecture of dreams and memory. Some projects can be viewed [here](https://refikanadolstudio.com/).

In a different way Nathalie Miebach focuses on converting scientific data from fields like meteorology and oceanography into intricate sculptures and musical scores, making complex scientific concepts accessible and engaging through art. Her  approach to data visualization is detailed on her [website](http://nathaliemiebach.com/).

## Tools and Technologies at the Intersection

Artists employ a variety of technologies to bridge data, math, and art. I dabbled with software like [Processing](https://processing.org/) - specifically designed for artists, designers and creative professionals. I mostly played with versions of the bird flocking simulation originally by Craig Reynolds ([good example](https://eater.net/boids)) here ([Pseudocode](http://www.kfish.org/boids/pseudocode.html) here). I still have a few things I want to try and it's been built using many languages and engines including React, Unity and so on.

[D3.js](https://d3js.org/) for interactive and dynamic art pieces,provides a powerful JavaScript library that enables data-driven transformations often used for sophisticated artistic visualizations.

However, Python is essential for data manipulation (using libraries like NumPy) and visualization (via Matplotlib) and as a gateway drug, I came across [Samila](https://www.samila.site/) -  most of my exploring has been there and I'm seeing how much I can stretch it.  

### The Transformer in the room...

In case it needs saying, Generative AI art is a different and huge topic which of course will have a huge impact. Exactly what that is and specifically how it will impact the types of things I've covered here:

## New Exploration

Exploring maths using visualisation is very established and is a key part of helping to build understanding as well as a tool. Using maths to generate visualisations and interactive environments is also a well developed medium. The integration of data science, mathematics, and art enriches our understanding of both art and data, offering a new framework that transforms complex datasets into engaging, visual, and sensory experiences. 

The intersection is not merely about creating aesthetically pleasing art; it’s also about crafting experiences that provoke thought, evoke emotions, and enhance our understanding of the hidden dynamics of our world. As we continue to explore this interdisciplinary nexus, the possibilities for new insights and aesthetic expressions seem boundless. 

But is it beautiful? But is it art? I don't have an easy answer but I'll keep playing with it, keep looking at it and wondering why you very rarely hear the parallel question: But is it maths?
