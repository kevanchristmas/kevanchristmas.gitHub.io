## tl:dr

Consumer impact is great and great

Payments is icebergs (we see the B2C)

How much has changed really?



**_Intro and Warning_:**

Been grinding on a work project which might reappear elsewhere here once the scars have healed sufficiently. Have the usual backlog of unfinished observations, explorations and ruminations for interesting adjacent areas but wanted to get this out as first off the pile.

The culmination of a few conversations, presentations and notes which overlapped.

In no particular order:

Friends/Family: "I just tap or use Apple/Google/Samsung Pay for everything now - Payments is so simple" 

Colleague: "I run my business out my phone/tablet - never been into a branch"

Colleague: "Hey, you do Product in Banking and Payments - could you give a quick overview to my team about payments, mobile banking and all that..."

So how did that turn out?

_(For full disclosure, I have been involved with Payments in various forms for over 12 years at National Payment Providers, banks, startups and card rail networks. I have experience both in the Business to Consumer (B2C) and Business to Business (B2B) arenas.)_

Now the warning... When you start explaining 'Payments' in terms of the processing behind even a 'simple' credit or debit card transaction to most people, the last vision many report before the coma hit was of an iceberg. The 10% seen is the swiping/tapping a card/phone or entering card details, then some bank stuff, then the approval (usually a couple of seconds) and I can have the thing. 90% is dark and murky and really only matters if you crash into it. 

(If you want to try this fun game in a safe and well padded space you can walk through the below diagram - explaining each of the actors and steps if you want full tonic immobility).

Yes, Mobile payments (cashless/cardless) **have** changed _everything_ - speed, convenience, service integration and customer expectations/behaviour. 

Nothing about the following has remained the same for anyone who has ever seen a cheque-book, mag-stripe card or feature phone (well maybe not the last one...)
- Processes -  retail shopping, ticketing/public transportation, Ordering/food & beverages
- Peer to Peer payments - sending/ sharing money (including overseas)
- Small and Micro Businesses with their own Point of Sale on a phone/tablet
- Notifications, controls, instant access to balances and of course doing it all remotely/online 

Obviously this is from a customer point of view but bearing in mind the iceberg above, what has actually changed, as it were - below the water?

Sure the iceberg is quite a lot faster than it used to be, it has some new pieces - largely to do with security (think biometrics, PIN Numbers etc.) real-time fraud detection built in plus some new faces (think QR codes, Digital wallets, switching between apps etc.) but the steps/flow needed before altering some digital balances remains largely unchanged.





Rather unsatisfactorily, the answer is not much really. There are new 





Conclusion 

So here's the point. The world of mobile 'banking' around a payment offers a comprehensive, secure and flexible management tool 

- "technology is never used to save time. It’s used to speed up production and consumption in order to expand the system" or put more simply: "tech doesn't make our lives easier it makes them faster"

There are all sorts of payments, and what's actually moving around anyway?

The 'sea' of payments is ever changing and evolving but it's still full of icebergs...


I don't completely follow the path he lays out but

Another dimension to the impact of  mobile banking trend goes beyond customer preference alone. The key driver of this shift has been the influence of digital-only challenger banks like Monzo and Revolut, which introduced business banking products that pushed traditional high-street banks to adapt and improve their own offerings. As mobile functionality continues to improve, this naturally fosters greater mobile adoption, reshaping users' expectations for managing business finances.

The transition to mobile as the primary platform for retail customers happened several years ago, making mobile banking a fundamental aspect of retail banking services. It’s reasonable to say that business banking customers now also expect at least a basic level of mobile functionality.

Obviously, the size and turnover of the enterprise is the main driver - from a project I worked on, roughly 50% of <£50,000 turnover businesses made use of the  mobile banking channel (not all functions), dropping to 30% for larger companies. However, the majority of total transactions are still done via desktop - the desktop portal is not going away any time soon. But, mobile apps are being used for other functionalities. This would include activities such as viewing statements, amending business details, and uploading receipts for expenses.

Functions such as managing sales, managing cards, creating virtual cards, setting limits etc. are all things which are also now expected across the board. The goal is of course, channel parity - meaning that all services are available based on customer preference to suit businesses irrespective of size.
